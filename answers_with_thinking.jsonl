The lace plant (Aponogeton madagascariensis) produces perforations in its leaves through PCD. The leaves of the plant consist of a latticework of longitudinal and transverse veins enclosing areoles. PCD occurs in the cells at the center of these areoles and progresses outwards, stopping approximately five cells from the vasculature. The role of mitochondria during PCD has been recognized in animals; however, it has been less studied during PCD in plants.\nRESULTS: The following paper elucidates the role of mitochondrial dynamics during developmentally regulated PCD in vivo in A. madagascariensis. A single areole within a window stage leaf (PCD is occurring) was divided into three areas based on the progression of PCD; cells that will not undergo PCD (NPCD), cells in early stages of PCD (EPCD), and cells in late stages of PCD (LPCD). Window stage leaves were stained with the mitochondrial dye MitoTracker Red CMXRos and examined. Mitochondrial dynamics were delineated into four categories (M1-M4) based on characteristics including distribution, motility, and membrane potential (ΔΨm). A TUNEL assay showed fragmented nDNA in a gradient over these mitochondrial stages. Chloroplasts and transvacuolar strands were also examined using live cell imaging. The possible importance of mitochondrial permeability transition pore (PTP) formation during PCD was indirectly examined via in vivo cyclosporine A (CsA) treatment. This treatment resulted in lace plant leaves with a significantly lower number of perforations compared to controls, and that displayed mitochondrial dynamics similar to that of non-PCD cells."}], "thinking": "<think>\nOkay, let's break down the question. The user is asking whether mitochondria play a role in remodelling lace plant leaves during programmed cell death (PCD). The context provided is a study on the lace plant (Aponogeton madagascariensis) and its PCD process.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the key points from the context. The study divided an areole into three stages based on PCD: NPCD (non-PCD), EPCD (early), and LPCD (late). They used mitochondrial dye MitoTracker Red CMXRos to stain and examined mitochondrial dynamics. They found fragmented DNA in the mitochondrial stages, indicating possible mitochondrial involvement. Also, they tested with CsA treatment, which reduced perforations, suggesting similar mitochondrial dynamics in non-PCD cells.\n\nNow, the question is about mitochondria's role in remodelling during PCD. The study's results show that during PCD, mitochondrial dynamics (like fragmented DNA) were similar to those in non-PCD cells. This implies that mitochondria might be involved in remodelling the leaves, possibly by altering their structure or function during PCD. The presence of fragmented DNA suggests some mitochondrial activity, which could be part of the remodelling process.\n\nThe conclusion from the study is that mitochondria's importance during PCD is significant. The data from the TUNEL assay and CsA treatment support this. Therefore, the answer should be \"yes,\" as the evidence confirms the role.\n</think>", "model_answer": "yes", "reference_long_answer": "Results depicted mitochondrial dynamics in vivo as PCD progresses within the lace plant, and highlight the correlation of this organelle with other organelles during developmental PCD.

Also, for the first time, we have shown the feasibility for the use of CsA in a whole plant system. Overall, our findings implicate the mitochondria as playing a critical and early role in developmentally regulated PCD in the lace plant.", "reference_final_decision": "yes"}

Since optotypes are evaluated on individuals with good visual acuity and without eye disorders, differences in the lower visual acuity range cannot be excluded. In this study, visual acuity measured with the Snellen E was compared to the Landolt C acuity.\nPATIENTS AND METHODS: 100 patients (age 8 - 90 years, median 60.5 years) with various eye disorders, among them 39 with amblyopia due to strabismus, and 13 healthy volunteers were tested. Charts with the Snellen E and the Landolt C (Precision Vision) which mimic the ETDRS charts were used to assess visual acuity. Three out of 5 optotypes per line had to be correctly identified, while wrong answers were monitored. In the group of patients, the eyes with the lower visual acuity, and the right eyes of the healthy subjects, were evaluated.\nRESULTS: Differences between Landolt C acuity (LR) and Snellen E acuity (SE) were small. The mean decimal values for LR and SE were 0.25 and 0.29 in the entire group and 0.14 and 0.16 for the eyes with strabismus amblyopia.

Since the results show that the mean difference is 0.55 lines, and in the strabismus group it's the same, but the overall mean difference is higher, it seems that the two methods have a significant difference. However, the context also mentions that differences in the lower visual acuity range cannot be excluded, which might suggest that the study is looking at the lower end. \n\nBut wait, the results specifically compared the entire group and only the strabismus group.

The combination of SLT and LRT has abolished deaths on the waiting list, thus raising the question whether living donor liver transplantation is still necessary.\nMETHODS: Outcomes and postoperative liver function of 43 primary LRT patients were compared with those of 49 primary SLT patients (14 ex situ, 35 in situ) with known graft weight performed between April 1996 and December 2000. Survival rates were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method.\nRESULTS: After a median follow-up of 35 months, actual patient survival rates were 82% in the SLT group and 88% in the LRT group. Actual graft survival rates were 76% and 81%, respectively. The incidence of primary nonfunction was 12% in the SLT group and 2.3% in the LRT group. Liver function parameters (prothrombin time, factor V, bilirubin clearance) and surgical complication rates did not differ significantly.

The goal is to evaluate the epidural acceptance and penetration into hospital practice by women and care givers and safety and efficacy during childbirth.\nPATIENTS AND METHODS: This audit cycle measured epidural analgesia performance against 4 standards: (1) Implementation of epidural analgesia for labor to all patients; (2) Acceptance and good satisfaction level reported by patients and caregivers. (3) Effectiveness of labor analgesia; (4) No maternal or fetal side effects.\nRESULTS: During the audit period epidural analgesia increased from 15.5% of all labors in the first trimester of the study to 51% in the last trimester (p<0.005). Satisfaction levels reported by patients and care givers were good. A hierarchical clustering analysis identified two clusters based on VAS (Visual Analogue Scale) time course: in 226 patients (cluster 1) VAS decreased from 8.5±1.4 before to 4.1±1.3 after epidural analgesia; in 1002 patients (cluster 2) VAS decreased from 8.12±1.7 before (NS vs cluster 1), to 0.76±0.79 after (p<0.001 vs before and vs cluster 2 after).

The audit found that epidural analgesia usage increased from 15.5% in the first trimester to 51% in the last, which is a significant rise. This suggests that the standard is now being adopted more widely. The satisfaction levels were good, which is positive. The hierarchical clustering analysis showed two clusters with different VAS (Visual Analog Scale) responses, indicating that the method is effective.\n\nBut wait, the question is about whether it's reachable in all women. The study didn't specifically address the reachability of the standard across different women, just the usage rates. The results show a significant increase, but the effectiveness and satisfaction data don't directly address the reachability. The clusters in the analysis might indicate that it works, but does that mean it's universally effective? Also, the study's goal was to evaluate acceptance and penetration into practice, which might include the standard's accessibility.\n\nSince the study's conclusion is that the standard is now being adopted and effective, but the question is about reachability in all women, which wasn't directly addressed, I need to infer. The increase in usage suggests that it's being implemented, but the effectiveness and satisfaction data don't confirm universal reachability.

Furthermore, frequencies of eye tracking during the 300 msec stimulus were significantly correlated with speed discrimination in control subjects (p = .01) but not in patients, suggesting that eye-tracking initiation may benefit control subjects but not patients.

Laypersons were handed a bag containing a LMAS, a bag mask valve device (BMV), a syringe prefilled with air and the instruction sheet, and were asked to perform and ventilate the manikin as displayed. Time to ventilation was recorded and degree of success evaluated.\nRESULTS: A total of 150 laypersons took part. Overall 145 participants (96.7%) inserted the LMAS in the manikin in the right direction. The device was inserted inverted or twisted in 13 (8.7%) attempts.

Because lysosomotropic amines can suppress major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II antigen presentation, their mechanism of action is potentially different from current immune suppressant drugs used to control GVHD such as cyclosporine.\nMETHODS: We investigated the use of cyclosporine and the lysosomotropic amines chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine in combination for additive or synergistic immunosuppression on T-cell responses in vitro to MiHC and MHC in mice.\nRESULTS: We found that similar concentrations of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine suppress the T-cell response to MiHC in mice (C57BL/6 anti-BALB.B) and that lysosomotropic amines in combination with cyclosporine result in synergistic suppression of a proliferative response to MiHC. Similar suppression and synergy appear to be present in an alloreactive response (C57BL/6 anti-BALB/c). Direct inhibition by chloroquine of T-cell proliferative responses induced by anti-CD3epsilon in the absence of antigen-presenting cells is present at higher concentrations than that required to suppress responses to MiHC or MHC.

There are very few studies which looked at detailed sputum and blood cell counts in a large cohort of asthmatics divided into inflammatory phenotypes. The purpose of this study was to analyze sputum cell counts, blood leukocytes and systemic inflammatory markers in these phenotypes, and investigate how those groups compared with healthy subjects.\nMETHODS: We conducted a retrospective cross-sectional study on 833 asthmatics recruited from the University Asthma Clinic of Liege and compared them with 194 healthy subjects. Asthmatics were classified into inflammatory phenotypes.\nRESULTS: The total non-squamous cell count per gram of sputum was greater in mixed granulocytic and neutrophilic phenotypes as compared to eosinophilic, paucigranulocytic asthma and healthy subjects (p < 0.005). Sputum eosinophils (in absolute values and percentages) were increased in all asthma phenotypes including paucigranulocytic asthma, compared to healthy subjects (p < 0.005). Eosinophilic asthma showed higher absolute sputum neutrophil and lymphocyte counts than healthy subjects (p < 0.005), while neutrophilic asthmatics had a particularly low number of sputum macrophages and epithelial cells. All asthma phenotypes showed an increased blood leukocyte count compared to healthy subjects (p < 0.005), with paucigranulocytic asthmatics having also increased absolute blood eosinophils compared to healthy subjects (p < 0.005).

The study compared different asthma phenotypes and found that paucigranulocytic asthmatics had higher counts of sputum cells, especially eosinophils, compared to healthy subjects. The conclusion is that these paucigranulocytic asthmatics are non-inflammatory. Wait, but the results mention that they have increased sputum eosinophils, which are a type of inflammation marker.

The study says that in mixed granulocytic and neutrophilic phenotypes, the non-squamous cell counts are higher, but in paucigranulocytic, there's more eosinophils. But the question is about paucigranulocytic asthmatics. The results indicate that they have higher eosinophils, which are associated with inflammation. So this would suggest that they are indeed inflammatory. \n\nBut then, the study also mentions that in all asthma phenotypes, there's increased leukocytes and systemic markers. However, the key point here is that in paucigranulocytic asthmatics, the sputum cells are higher, especially eosinophils, which are a part of the immune response.

Therefore, the answer is \"maybe\" because there's a possibility, but the evidence doesn't confirm it.

The study mentions that even with extended fasting (up to 8.5 hours for liquids and 20.5 for solids), all animals had gastric content. So, they didn't have any pre-existing gastric issues.

Wait, the answer needs to be one word. Since the study found that even with fasting, there was gastric content, it's not necessary.

Therefore, the answer is \"yes\" because the evidence shows that preoperative fasting isn't required. Wait, but the study says that even with strict fasting, all animals had gastric content. So maybe the answer is \"maybe\" because there's no evidence against it. Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me read again.

However, the height of the infundibulum was significantly different between the two groups. \n\nWait, so the height was the only parameter where there was a difference. That suggests that the height of the infundibulum might be a predictor. But the question is whether it predicts removal. Since the study found that patients with higher infundibulum height had better outcomes (no stones), that supports the idea that the height is a factor. The other factors didn't show significant differences, so maybe the height is the key. \n\nTherefore, based on the evidence, the answer should be yes. The height does predict the clearance of stones after SWL. The other factors weren't significant, so only the height is relevant here. I think that's the conclusion.\n</think>", "model_answer": "yes", "reference_long_answer": "Lower Infundibular height could be a good measurement tool for deciding which patients with lower calyceal lithiasis would benefit from SWL treatment.

To determine the hemodynamic effect due to lung IR injury, we performed a quantitative coronary blood-flow analysis in a swine model of in situ lung ischemia and reperfusion.\nMETHODS: In 14 healthy pigs, blood flow was measured in the ascending aorta, left anterior descending (LAD), circumflex (Cx), right coronary artery (RCA), right common carotid artery (RCCA), and left internal mammary artery (LIMA), along with left-and right-ventricular pressures (LVP and RVP), aortic pressure (AoP), and pulmonary artery pressure (PAP). Cardiac Troponin (cTn), interleukin 6 and 10 (IL-6 and IL-10), and tumor necrosis factor A (TNF-A) were measured in coronary sinus blood samples. The experimental (IR) group (n=10) underwent 60 min of lung ischemia followed by 60 min of reperfusion by clamping and releasing the left pulmonary hilum. Simultaneous measurements of all parameters were made at baseline and during IR. The control group (n=4) had similar measurements without lung IR.\nRESULTS: In the IR group, total coronary flow (TCF=LAD+Cx+RCA blood-flow) decreased precipitously and significantly from baseline (113±41 ml min\"1) during IR (p<0.05), with the lowest value observed at 60 min of reperfusion (-37.1%, p<0.003). Baseline cTn (0.08±0.02 ng ml(-1)) increased during IR and peaked at 45 min of reperfusion (+138%, p<0.001). Baseline IL-6 (9.2±2.17 pg ml(-1)) increased during IR and peaked at 60 min of reperfusion (+228%, p<0.0001). Significant LVP drop at 5 min of ischemia (p<0.05) was followed by a slow return to baseline at 45 min of ischemia. A second LVP drop occurred at reperfusion (p<0.05) and persisted.

The BMD at both sites decreased precipitously within 24 months of stopping treatment, raising the question as to whether bisphosphonates can be stopped in a growing child with skeletal fragility.\nINTRODUCTION: At age 23 months, a male toddler sustained a low trauma fracture of his right femur. Skeletal radiographs revealed generalised osteopenia with multiple vertebral body fractures. He was diagnosed with type IV osteogenesis imperfecta; however, no mutations were found in COL1A1 or COL1A2 genes.\nMETHODS: This case report presents bone densitometry data before, during and after bisphosphonate treatment.

After 4 years of treatment his vertebral fractures had been remodelled and all bone densitometry values (QCT, DXA and pQCT) were within normal range and therefore treatment was discontinued. Shortly after this he suffered stress fractures of his left mid tibia and at the sclerotic metaphyseal line corresponding to his first APD treatment. He had marked reduction in spinal trabecular and distal radial vBMD; change in BMAD was less marked."}], "thinking": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The question is whether bisphosphonate treatment can be stopped in a growing child with skeletal fragility. The context provided is about a 2-year-old child who had a fracture and was treated with cyclical pamidronate. After stopping the treatment, their bone density (BMD) decreased, leading to questions about stopping the treatment.\n\nThe study mentions that the BMD at both distal radial and spinal sites decreased significantly within 24 months. However, the results show that after 4 years of treatment, the BMD was within normal range, so the treatment was discontinued. Then, after stopping, they had stress fractures in the left mid tibia and at the sclerotic metaphyseal line, which correspond to the first APD treatment. They also noted a reduction in spinal trabecular and distal radial vBMD, but the change in BMAD was less marked.\n\nSo, the key points here are: stopping the treatment led to a decrease in BMD, but after 4 years, it returned to normal. The child then had new fractures, which suggest that the treatment might not be effective. However, the study's conclusion was that the treatment was discontinued because of the decrease in BMD. But the question is whether stopping is possible in a growing child. \n\nThe evidence here is that stopping the treatment led to a decrease in BMD, which might be a sign that the treatment is no longer effective. However, the child is still growing, so stopping could be considered. The study didn't address whether stopping is safe, only the outcomes. Since the BMD decreased after stopping, it's possible that the child's skeletal condition improved, but there's a risk of new fractures. \n\nBut the answer depends on whether the decrease in BMD is a positive sign. If the child is still growing and the BMD is decreasing, it might indicate that the treatment is no longer effective.

The purpose of this cadaveric study was twofold: 1. to determine whether femoral tunnel lengths of greater than 20 mm can be created with a flexible reamer system at 90 ° of knee flexion and 2. to determine whether the lateral structures of the knee are safe with this technique.\nMETHODS: Ten fresh cadaveric knees were utilized. The intra-osseous length can be measured with a specially de - signed flexible guide pin. Flexible pins were inserted with the knee at 70°, 90°, and 120° of flexion. The intra-osseous length was measured with the measuring device. Each speci - men was dissected around the lateral aspect of the knee to identify the critical structures, the common peroneal nerve, and the LCL. The distance from the guide pins to the com - mon peroneal nerve and femoral attachment of the LCL were measured with a standard flexible paper ruler to the nearest millimeter.\nRESULTS: There is a trend for progressively increasing mean intra-osseous length associated with increased flexion of the knee. The mean intra-osseous length for 70° flexion was 25.2 mm (20 mm to 32 mm), which was statistically significant when compared to mean intra-osseous lengths of 32.1 mm (22 mm to 45 mm) and 38.0 mm (34 mm to 45 mm) in the 90° and 120° flexion groups, respectively (p<0.05).

Also, body fat percentage wasn't associated with Framingham risk after considering insulin sensitivity.\n\nThe key point here is that insulin resistance (insulin sensitivity was measured as a factor) was found to be inversely related to Framingham risk.

Although botulinum toxin is used to reduce spasticity, its functional benefits are less easily demonstrated. This paper reports an exploratory meta-analysis to investigate the relationship between reduced arm spasticity and improved arm function.\nMETHOD: Individual data from stroke patients in two randomised controlled trials of intra-muscular botulinum toxin were pooled. The Modified Ashworth Scale (elbow, wrist, fingers) was used to calculate a \"Composite Spasticity Index\". Data from the arm section of the Barthel Activities of Daily Living Index (dressing, grooming, and feeding) and three subjective measures (putting arm through sleeve, cleaning palm, cutting fingernails) were summed to give a \"Composite Functional Index\". Change scores and the time of maximum change were also calculated.\nRESULTS: Maximum changes in both composite measures occurred concurrently in 47 patients. In 26 patients the improvement in spasticity preceded the improvement in function with 18 showing the reverse. There was a definite relationship between the maximum change in spasticity and the maximum change in arm function, independent of treatment (rho = -0.2822, p = 0.0008, n = 137).

The volume of stroke was determined by computerized image analysis of CT films and CT images stored on computer tape and optical disks. Cube-root transformation of lesion volume was performed for each CT. Transformed lesion volume was analyzed in a logistic regression model to predict volume of stroke by NIHSS score for each hemisphere. Spearman rank correlation was used to determine the relation between the NIHSS score and lesion volume.\nRESULTS: The volume for right hemisphere stroke was statistically greater than the volume for left hemisphere strokes, adjusting for the baseline NIHSS (P<0. 001). For each 5-point category of the NIHSS score<20, the median volume of right hemisphere strokes was approximately double the median volume of left hemisphere strokes. For example, for patients with a left hemisphere stroke and a 24-hour NIHSS score of 16 to 20, the median volume of cerebral infarction was 48 mL (interquartile range 14 to 111 mL) as compared with 133 mL (interquartile range 81 to 208 mL) for patients with a right hemisphere stroke (P<0.001).

Students kept records about each case in a log book and also presented their cases at weekly Problem Based Learning tutorials. An audit of student log books and review of tutorial records was conducted for the 1996 and 1997 academic years, in order to evaluate student contribution to QA.\nRESULTS: Students followed 621 cases, representing a sampling of 14. 1% day surgery cases. Categories of problems highlighted by students included inappropriate patient and procedure selection, inadequate pain management, discharge, communication and resource issues. Students made a number of recommendations including the development of multilingual videotapes and patient information sheets for non-English speaking patients, avoidance of bilateral surgical procedures and improved links with local medical officers.

The objective of our study was to analyze prognostic factors related to survival and to see whether cytostatic treatment was an independent predictor.\nPATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients enrolled in the study had been diagnosed with non-small cell carcinoma in stages IV or IIIB with pleural or N2-N3 involvement and with a performance status of 2 or below according to the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG). Survival was analyzed with regard to the following variables: age, sex, comorbidity, weight loss, laboratory test results, histological type, ECOG score, TNM staging, and treatment. The Student t test, the chi(2) test, the Kaplan-Meier method, the log-rank test, and Cox regression analysis were used in the statistical analysis.\nRESULTS: We enrolled 190 patients (157 men and 33 women) with a mean (SD) age of 61.75 (10.85) years (range, 33-85 years). Of these patients, 144 received cytostatic treatment and 46 palliative treatment.

It often mimics a gallbladder carcinoma (GBC), and may coexist with GBC, leading to a diagnostic dilemma. Furthermore, the premalignant nature of this entity is not known. This study was undertaken to assess the p53, PCNA and beta-catenin expression in XGC in comparison to GBC and chronic inflammation.\nMETHODS: Sections from paraffin-embedded blocks of surgically resected specimens of GBC (69 cases), XGC (65), chronic cholecystitis (18) and control gallbladder (10) were stained with the monoclonal antibodies to p53 and PCNA, and a polyclonal antibody to beta-catenin. p53 expression was scored as the percentage of nuclei stained. PCNA expression was scored as the product of the percentage of nuclei stained and the intensity of the staining (1-3). A cut-off value of 80 for this score was taken as a positive result. Beta-catenin expression was scored as type of expression-membranous, cytoplasmic or nuclear staining.\nRESULTS: p53 mutation was positive in 52% of GBC cases and 3% of XGC, but was not expressed in chronic cholecystitis and control gallbladders. p53 expression was lower in XGC than in GBC (P<0.0001). PCNA expression was seen in 65% of GBC cases and 11% of XGC, but not in chronic cholecystitis and control gallbladders. PCNA expression was higher in GBC than XGC (P=0.0001), but there was no significant difference between the XGC, chronic cholecystitis and control gallbladder groups. Beta-catenin expression was positive in the GBC, XGC, chronic cholecystitis and control gallbladder groups.

The study didn't find any evidence that XGC is premalignant. Instead, it compared it with GBC and chronic cholecystitis. Since p53 and PCNA are markers for cancer, but XGC didn't show these markers in the same proportion or pattern as GBC, it's possible that XGC is not premalignant. Also, the expression pattern in XGC was different from GBC, but the study didn't specifically address premalignancy. \n\nTherefore, based on the provided data, the answer should be \"maybe\" because the evidence doesn't confirm or refute the premalignant status definitively.

Apical vertebra or disc is defined as the most laterally deviated vertebra or disc in a scoliosis curve, but the most rotated vertebra (or disc) has not been included in this terminology. One study suggested that the most rotated vertebral level was always located at the apex.\nMETHODS: Thirty-three structural curves of 25 consecutive patients scheduled for surgery for thoracic or thoracolumbar scoliosis were analyzed with standing anteroposterior radiographs and computed tomography scans covering the curve apexes and pelvis. Thoracic and lumbar curves were evaluated separately for all Type II curves. Vertebral rotations were normalized by the rotation of the pelvis. The most rotated vertebral (or disc) levels (transverse apex) were compared with the regional and global apex levels (vertebra or disc) (coronal apexes) of the corresponding curves separately.\nRESULTS: Regional and global apexes were at the same level in 18 (54.5%) curves, and within half a level in another 15 (45.4%), and the regional apex was one level higher in two curves (95% confidence levels: -0.82, +0.88).

The PEA-BP phenotype was defined by DSM-IV mania with at least one of the cardinal symptoms of mania (elation and/or grandiosity) to avoid diagnosing mania only by symptoms that overlapped with those for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Comprehensive assessment of the probands included separate Washington University in St. Louis Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia (WASH-U-KSADS) interviews of parents about their children and of children about themselves.

The aim of this study was to examine whether an optimistic outlook predicts survival among the oldest-old.\nMETHODS: The Danish 1905 Cohort Survey is a nationwide, longitudinal survey comprising all individuals born in Denmark in 1905. At baseline in 1998, a total of 2,262 persons aged 92 or 93 agreed to participate in the intake survey.

When confounding factors such as baseline physical and cognitive functioning and disease were taken into account the association between optimism and survival weakened in both sexes, but the general pattern persisted. Optimistic women were still at lower risk of death compared to neutral women [HR 0.85, 95 % CI (0.74-0.97)].

Recently, it has been shown to regulate circadian clocks. In seasonal breeding species such as sheep, the circadian clock controls the secretion of an endogenous rhythm of melatonin and, as a consequence, is probably involved in the generation of seasonal rhythms of reproduction. Considering this, we identified the presence of the subunits of AMPK in different hypothalamic nuclei involved in the pre- and post-pineal pathways that control seasonality of reproduction in the ewe and we investigated if the intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection of two activators of AMPK, metformin and AICAR, affected the circadian rhythm of melatonin in ewes that were housed in constant darkness. In parallel the secretion of insulin was monitored as a peripheral metabolic marker. We also investigated the effects of i.c.v. AICAR on the phosphorylation of AMPK and acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), a downstream target of AMPK, in brain structures along the photoneuroendocrine pathway to the pineal gland.\nRESULTS: All the subunits of AMPK that we studied were identified in all brain areas that were dissected but with some differences in their level of expression among structures. Metformin and AICAR both reduced (p<0.001 and p<0.01 respectively) the amplitude of the circadian rhythm of melatonin secretion independently of insulin secretion. The i.c.v. injection of AICAR only tended (p = 0.1) to increase the levels of phosphorylated AMPK in the paraventricular nucleus but significantly increased the levels of phosphorylated ACC in the paraventricular nucleus (p<0.001) and in the pineal gland (p<0.05)."}], "thinking": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question.

Furthermore, impaired phonological processing has been implicated as the cognitive basis in struggling readers. Here, we explored the reading skills in participants who have undergone left cerebral hemispherectomy.\nMETHODS: Seven individuals who have undergone left cerebral hemispherectomy to control intractable seizures associated with perinatal infarct have been recruited for this study. We examined if components of phonological processing that are shown to reliably separate average readers from struggling readers, i.e., phonological awareness, verbal memory, speed of retrieval, and size of vocabulary, show the same relationship to reading levels when they are mediated by the right hemisphere [2].\nRESULTS: We found that about 60% of our group developed both word reading and paragraph reading in the average range.

The present article analyzes the effect of open access publishing of scientific articles in intensive care medicine journals in terms of citations count.\nMETHODS: We evaluated a total of 161 articles (76% being non-open access articles) published in Intensive Care Medicine in the year 2008.

Multiple associated abnormalities have been recognized within the external hypertrophied pyloric muscle layer, but the internal component of the pyloric mucosa has received scant attention in the literature to date. Our purpose in this study was to show that pyloric mucosal redundancy is a constant finding in infants with IHPS, to discuss its possible cause, and to explore the hypothesis of a relationship between pyloric mucosal redundancy and the development of IHPS.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: We identified 102 consecutive infants with surgically confirmed IHPS and determined the thickness of the pyloric mucosa compared with the thickness of the surrounding hypertrophied muscle. Fifty-one infants who did not have pyloric stenosis served as controls.\nRESULTS: Mean mucosal thickness in patients with IHPS approximated mean muscle thickness, with a ratio of 0.89.

Thirty-four subjects (mean age 55 years, body mass index 34 kg/m 2 , fasting triglycerides 3.5 mmol/L) with diagnosed sleep apnoea syndrome not treated with continuous positive airways pressure were enrolled and randomized to once daily treatment with fenofibrate (145 mg NanoCrystal(R) tablet) or placebo. Overnight polysomnography, computerized attention/vigilance tests and blood sampling for measurement of lipids, insulin, fasting plasma glucose and fibrinogen were performed at the end of each study period.\nCLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT00816829.\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: As this was an exploratory study, a range of sleep variables were evaluated. The apnoea/hypopnoea index (AHI) and percentage of time spent with arterial oxygen saturation (SpO(2))<90% were relevant as they have been evaluated in other clinical trials.

The study's conclusion is that there's no significant difference in lymph node metastasis between NACT and non-NACT groups, and the metastatic rates decreased in the NACT group. However, the study doesn't mention anything about modifying the extent of lymphadenectomy based on NACT. It only talks about the presence of lymph node metastasis and its impact. \n\nSince the study didn't find any significant differences in lymph node metastasis extent between groups, and the conclusion is that NACT reduces metastasis, there's no evidence to suggest that modifying the extent of lymphadenectomy could be done. Therefore, the answer should be \"yes\" because the evidence supports that modifying the extent of lymphadenectomy might be possible, but the study doesn't provide that information. Wait, but the study didn't discuss modifying the extent. The results only show that NACT reduces metastasis, not that the extent can be adjusted. So maybe the answer is \"maybe\" because the evidence is inconclusive. But the user's question is about modifying the extent, not the presence of metastasis. The study's conclusion is about the presence of metastasis, not the extent. Therefore, the answer should be \"maybe\" because there's no direct evidence in the study that modifies the extent. Alternatively, since the study found no significant difference, maybe the answer is \"yes\" because the evidence supports that modifying the extent could be done. Hmm, this is a bit confusing. The study says that the incidence of metastasis decreased in the NACT group, which suggests that the extent might be reduced, but the question is about modifying the extent. The study doesn't discuss modifying the extent, only the presence of metastasis. So perhaps the answer is \"maybe\" because there's no evidence to confirm or deny modifying the extent. But I need to check again. The study's conclusion is that NACT reduces metastasis, but does it suggest that modifying the extent could be done? No, the study only says that the presence of metastasis is reduced. Therefore, the answer should be \"maybe\" because the evidence is inconclusive. Wait, but maybe the answer is \"yes\" because the study shows that lymph node metastasis is reduced, which implies that modifying the extent (like removing more lymph nodes) might be possible. But the study doesn't mention modifying the extent. The conclusion is about the presence of metastasis, not the extent. So the answer is \"maybe\". But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe \"yes\" because the presence of metastasis is reduced, which could mean that the extent of lymphadenectomy is modified. But I think the correct answer here is \"maybe\" because the study doesn't provide information on modifying the extent, only the effect of NACT on metastasis.

So, even though the study found 20 cases where the videofluoroscopy showed aspiration, the bedside missed 10, which means it's not 100% reliable. \n\nThen, the results also mention that the speech and language therapist had a sensitivity of 22%, and the medical assessment had 41% for the same. These are lower than the bedside's 47%, which suggests that the bedside assessment isn't as accurate. \n\nAdditionally, the study used multiple logistic regression to identify factors. The key factors were a weak voluntary cough and any alteration in conscious level. The sensitivity of those factors was 75%, which is higher than the bedside's 47%. This implies that those factors are more accurate in detecting aspiration.\n\nPutting this all together, the conclusion is that while the bedside assessment has some reliability, it isn't as effective as the other methods.

Research into health inequalities frequently fails to recognise spatial heterogeneity in the deprivation-health relationship, assuming that global relationships apply uniformly across geographical areas. In this study, exploratory spatial data analysis methods are used to assess local patterns in deprivation and mortality. Spatial regression models are then implemented to examine the relationship between deprivation and mortality more formally.\nRESULTS: The initial exploratory spatial data analysis reveals concentrations of high standardized mortality ratios (SMR) and deprivation (hotspots) in the West of Scotland and concentrations of low values (coldspots) for both variables in the rest of the country. The main spatial regression result is that deprivation is the only variable that is highly significantly correlated with all-cause mortality in all models. However, in contrast to the expected spatial heterogeneity in the deprivation-mortality relationship, this relation does not vary between regions in any of the models. This result is robust to a number of specifications, including weighting for population size, controlling for spatial autocorrelation and heteroskedasticity, assuming a non-linear relationship between mortality and socio-economic deprivation, separating the dependent variable into male and female SMRs, and distinguishing between West, North and Southeast regions.

Similarly, epiphysial growth relies on endochondral ossification from the circumferential secondary physeal [corrected]. injury can result in disruption of normal ossification. The cause of juvenile osteochondritis dissecans (OCD) remains elusive. We hypothesized that juvenile OCD results from an insult affecting endochondral ossification from the secondary physis. The purpose of our study was to evaluate the MRI appearance of the distal femoral epiphysis-particularly the secondary physis-of children with juvenile OCD and to compare these findings with the MRI findings of unaffected children.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: Knee MRI examinations of 30 children (age range, 8 years 8 months to 13 years 4 months) with OCD and 30 matched control patients were evaluated for skeletal maturity; location of the OCD lesion, if present; secondary physeal [corrected] continuity; overlying chondroepiphysial integrity, contour, and width; signal intensity of subchondral bone; and secondary physeal [corrected]conspicuity. Variables were compared using chi-square tests.\nRESULTS: All children were skeletally immature. Condylar lesions were medial in 24 knees and lateral in six knees. All were in the middle one third, posterior one third, or middle and posterior thirds in the sagittal plane. The majority of lesions spanned the intercondylar and middle one third of the femoral condyle in the coronal plane (73%). There was a significant difference between secondary physeal [corrected] disruption in juvenile OCD condyles compared with unaffected condyles (p<0.001) and control condyles (p<0.001). Compared with unaffected and control condyles, the OCD group showed chondroepiphysial widening (p<0.001) and subchondral bone edema (p<0.001) on MRI.

Recent studies have found direct associations between specific SNPs and breast cancer in BRCA1/2 mutation carriers. Our aim was to determine whether validated susceptibility SNP scores improve the predictive ability of risk models in comparison/conjunction to other clinical/demographic information.\nMETHODS: Female BRCA1/2 carriers were identified from the Manchester genetic database, and included in the study regardless of breast cancer status or age. DNA was extracted from blood samples provided by these women and used for gene and SNP profiling. Estimates of survival were examined with Kaplan-Meier curves. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were fit in the separate BRCA datasets and in menopausal stages screening different combinations of clinical/demographic/genetic variables. Nonlinear random survival forests were also fit to identify relevant interactions. Models were compared using Harrell's concordance index (1 - c-index).\nRESULTS: 548 female BRCA1 mutation carriers and 523 BRCA2 carriers were identified from the database. Median Kaplan-Meier estimate of survival was 46.0 years (44.9-48.1) for BRCA1 carriers and 48.9 (47.3-50.4) for BRCA2. By fitting Cox models and random survival forests, including both a genetic SNP score and clinical/demographic variables, average 1 - c-index values were 0.221 (st.dev. 0.019) for BRCA1 carriers and 0.215 (st.dev. 0.018) for BRCA2 carriers."}], "thinking": "<think>\nOkay, so the question is whether multiple SNP testing in BRCA1 and BRCA2 carriers can improve risk prediction models when combined with clinical assessments.

They used survival analysis with Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox models with SNP scores and clinical/demographic factors. They also used non-linear random survival forests to assess interactions.\n\nThe results showed that the average 1 - c-index was 0.221 for BRCA1 and 0.215 for BRCA2. The c-index is a measure of how well a model predicts the actual outcomes, right? A higher c-index means better predictive accuracy. \n\nSo, the study found that using SNP scores (combined with clinical info) improved the model's predictive ability. The c-index was higher, which suggests that the models were more accurate. But the question is whether this improvement is valid. Since the study compared using SNP scores with clinical info to other methods, and the results show a better 1 - c-index, it seems like the evidence supports that multiple SNPs in BRCA carriers can indeed improve risk prediction models when combined with clinical assessments.\n\nWait, but the original question was about \"multiple SNP testing\" in BRCA carriers. The study did use multiple SNP tests (maybe multiple SNPs?), but the results showed better predictive power.

Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) software allows the semi-automatic analysis of the kinetic characteristics of complete enhancing lesions, providing additional information about lesion vasculature. The diagnostic value of this information has not yet been quantified.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: Consecutive patients from routine diagnostic studies (1.5 T, 0.1 mmol gadopentetate dimeglumine, dynamic gradient-echo sequences at 1-minute intervals) were analyzed prospectively using CAD. Dynamic sequences were processed and reduced to a parametric map. Curve types were classified by initial signal increase (not significant, intermediate, and strong) and the delayed time course of signal intensity (continuous, plateau, and washout).

They recruited 50 RA patients who were on s.c. anti-TNF agents. They used clinical and lab measures (DAS28 and SDAI) along with ultrasound assessments at peak and trough concentrations. The ultrasound assessments were blind to the drug, administration time, and the data.

In the UK, the result has been that many rural maternity units have become midwife-led. A key consideration is that midwives have the skills to competently and confidently provide maternity services in rural areas, which may be geographically isolated and where the midwife may only see a small number of pregnant women each year. Our objective was to compare the views of midwives in rural and urban settings, regarding their competence and confidence with respect to 'competencies' identified as being those which all professionals should have in order to provide effective and safe care for low-risk women.\nMETHOD: This was a comparative questionnaire survey involving a stratified sample of remote and rural maternity units and an ad hoc comparison group of three urban maternity units in Scotland. Questionnaires were sent to 82 midwives working in remote and rural areas and 107 midwives working in urban hospitals with midwife-led units.\nRESULTS: The response rate from midwives in rural settings was considerably higher (85%) than from midwives in the urban areas (60%). Although the proportion of midwives who reported that they were competent was broadly similar in the two groups, there were some significant differences regarding specific competencies. Midwives in the rural group were more likely to report competence for breech delivery (p = 0.001), while more urban midwives reported competence in skills such as intravenous fluid replacement (p<0.001) and initial and discharge examination of the newborn (p<0.001). Both groups reported facing barriers to continuing professional development; however, more of the rural group had attended an educational event within the last month (p<0.001). Lack of time was a greater barrier for urban midwives (p = 0.02), whereas distance to training was greater for rural midwives (p = 0.009). Lack of motivation or interest was significantly higher in urban units (p = 0.006)."}], "thinking": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether midwives' competence is affected by working in a rural location.

The main point is that competence levels were similar but had differences in specific competencies. For example, rural midwives were more likely to report competence in breech delivery, while urban ones had higher competence in IV fluid replacement and newborn exams. Also, rural midwives faced more barriers like time and lack of motivation, while urban had issues with distance and training.\n\nThe key here is whether rural locations affect competence. The study shows that rural midwives might have more resources or access to training, which could affect their competence. However, there are differences in specific areas. For instance, rural midwives might have more opportunities to learn about certain skills. But the results don't fully address whether rural locations inherently affect competence. They do mention some differences but don't explicitly state that rural locations inherently reduce or increase competence.\n\nThe conclusion should be based on the data. The results show that rural midwives might have more competence in certain areas but still face some barriers. Since the study didn't eliminate the effect of rural locations, but instead showed differences, it's possible that rural locations do affect competence.

Intraoperatively, the internal aortic annulus diameter was measured by insertion of a gauge (Hegar dilator), while prosthesis size was determined by using the original sizers. Transthoracic echocardiography was performed to determine hemodynamic and dimensional data. As the aim of AVR is to achieve a maximal effective orifice area (EOA) within a given aortic annulus, the ratio of EOA to patient aortic annulus area was calculated, the latter being based on annulus diameter measured intraoperatively.\nRESULTS: Operative mortality was 2.2% (Mosaic 3.0%; Perimount 1.4%; p = NS).

The animals were allocated to: control group (n: 6): Pressure dressing was applied with manual pressure over gauze sponge; or QC group (n: 10): QC was directly applied over lacerated femoral artery. Mean arterial pressure, blood loss and physiological parameters were measured during the study period.\nRESULTS: Application of QC led to a slower drop in blood pressure. The control group had a significantly higher increase in lactate within 60 minutes. The mean prothrombin time in the control group was significantly increased at 60 minutes. The application of QC led to decreased total blood loss. The QC group had significantly higher hematocrit levels. QC application generated a significant heat production.

The question is whether zeolite hemostatic agent is beneficial in reducing blood loss during arterial injury. The context provided is a study in swine extremity arterial injury models.\n\nFirst, the study used six animals in the control group with manual pressure and ten in the QC group. The main goal was to evaluate blood loss and physiological parameters. The results show that QC application led to a slower drop in blood pressure. The control group had higher lactate levels and increased prothrombin time, while the QC group had lower total blood loss, higher hematocrit, and significant heat production. Also, there were changes in nerve samples.\n\nSo, the key points here are reduced blood loss in the QC group compared to the control. The control group had higher lactate and prothrombin time, which might indicate some issues, but the QC group showed benefits. The heat production and hematocrit increase in the QC group are positive. The edematous and vacuolar changes in nerve samples suggest some healing. \n\nSince the study found that QC reduced blood loss, that would support the idea that it's beneficial.

Some of the questions regarding TasP strategies arise from the perceived difficulties in achieving and maintaining viral load (VL) suppression over time and the risk of emergence of viral resistance that could compromise future treatment options. This study was conducted to assess these questions in a resource-limited setting.\nMETHODOLOGY: We performed a retrospective observational study of HIV-infected patients diagnosed in the pre-HAART era on follow-up at a private center from Buenos Aires, Argentina. Socio-demographic, clinical, and laboratory data were extracted from clinical charts. Analyses were performed to test for potential associations of selected variables with current virologic failure or use of third-line drugs.\nRESULTS: Of 619 patients on follow-up, 82 (13.2%) were diagnosed in the pre-HAART era. At the time of our study, 79 (96.3%) patients were on HAART, with a median duration of 14 years (IQR 12-15) of therapy, and exposure to mono or dual nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors regimens in 47.8% of cases. Sixty-nine patients (87.3%) had undetectable VL, 37 (46.8%) never presented virologic failure, and 19 (24.1%) experienced only one failure. Thirteen patients (16.5%) were receiving third-line ART regimens, with an average of 2.7-fold more virologic failures than those on first- or second-line regimens (p = 0.007)."}], "thinking": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The question is whether it's feasible to maintain HIV viral load suppression over time in resource-limited settings. The user provided a context about a study on treatment as prevention in resource-limited areas.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the methodology. They did a retrospective study of HIV-infected patients from Buenos Aires, Argentina. They used clinical charts and extracted data on socio-demographics, clinical, and lab information. They analyzed data to see if certain variables were linked to virologic failure or third-line drugs.\n\nThe results mention that 82 out of 619 patients were diagnosed in the pre-HAART era. At the time of the study, 79% were on HAART, with a median duration of 14 years. There were 47.8% of patients using mono or dual nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. The study found that 87.3% of patients had undetectable viral load, 37 had no virologic failure, and 19 had only one failure. Also, 69% had third-line ART regimens, which had more virologic failures.\n\nNow, the key here is whether maintaining viral load suppression over time is feasible. The study's results show that many patients had undetectable viral load, which is a good indicator of sustained suppression. However, the study didn't directly address the feasibility aspect. It only looked at the presence of undetectable viral load and virologic failures. \n\nThe study's conclusion is based on these data, but the question is about feasibility. Even if some patients had undetectable viral load, the study's results don't explicitly state whether this is feasible. The feasibility would depend on factors like access to treatment, resources, and the ability to sustain virologic suppression without resistance. Since the study didn't address these factors, the answer would be \"maybe\" because there's not enough evidence to confirm or refute the feasibility.\n\nI need to make sure I'm not making up information. The context mentions that 82 out of 619 patients were diagnosed in the pre-HAART era, which is a significant number, but the study's focus is on virologic failure and the use of third-line drugs.

The answer should be \"maybe\" because there's not enough evidence to confirm or refute the feasibility.\n</think>", "model_answer": "maybe", "reference_long_answer": "Maintaining viral load suppression over time in resource-limited-settings is feasible.", "reference_final_decision": "yes"}

Annual patient-level cohorts provide information on ex ante health status, procedure use, expenditures, and health outcomes.\nSTUDY DESIGN: The patient is the primary unit of analysis.

Weekend admission leads to a 3.47 percentage point reduction in catheterization at 1 day, a 1.52 point reduction in angioplasty, and a 0.35 point reduction in by-pass surgery (p<.001 in all cases).

If weekend patients have delayed procedures, does that mean their care quality is lower? Delayed treatment could imply that they don't receive the necessary care as quickly, which might be a sign of lower quality.

From what I remember, it's a position where the patient is placed in a supine position with the legs elevated. The idea is to reduce blood flow to the lower limbs, which might prevent compartment syndrome. \n\nLooking at the context, the study mentions that using the modified lithotomy position (which is the standard position with legs elevated) didn't show a decrease in lower limb perfusion.

PD on the visual analog scale (VAS) was assessed during a methacholine-induced FEV(1) decrease and specifically was quantified as the VAS slope and score at an FEV(1) decrease of 5 to 20%. BHR was assessed in terms of the provocative concentration of methacholine causing a 20% fall in FEV(1) (PC(20)). Eosinophil counts in induced sputum samples also were performed. Regression analysis, univariate analysis of variance, and factor analysis were applied for statistical evaluation.\nRESULTS: For a 5 to 20% fall in FEV(1) from the lowest point after saline solution induction, VAS score was lowest in group II, slightly higher in group I, slightly higher still in group IV, and the highest in group III. In the patients as a whole, BHR related to PD, but age, clinical score, duration of the disease, and presence of baseline airway obstruction did not. In patients with obstruction who were treated with ICSs, eosinophil counts related to PD negatively.

The MACE was defined as combination of all-cause death, nonfatal coronary event and nonfatal stroke.\nRESULTS: During mean follow-up of 2.6 ± 1.6 years among 868 patients after AMI, 34.4% achieved non-HDL-C target, 23.7% achieved LDL-C target and 21.2% experienced MACEs.

They found that patients with non-HDL-C above 130 mg/dl had a higher risk of MACEs (HR 3.15). However, when comparing LDL-C levels, there was a significant association. Patients with LDL-C above 100 mg/dl had a lower risk of MACEs compared to those with LDL-C below 70 mg/dl. \n\nSo, the results suggest that non-HDL-C is a better predictor.

Various clinical conditions, such as term versus preterm gestation, first stage versus second stage of labor, and fetal heart rate (FHR) variable decelerations versus late decelerations will be tested.\nMETHODS: During the study period, 113 patients were studied prospectively in either active phase of first stage (n = 53) or during the second stage of labor (n = 60). They were selected from cases exhibiting moderate to severe FHR variable decelerations or late decelerations. The fetuses of study subjects received a VAS for three seconds and FHR changes were recorded. Fetal scalp blood pH or umbilical arterial blood pH was obtained within 15 minutes of VAS. The relationship between FHR responses to VAS and fetal blood pH in term and preterm gestations, the relationship of two tests (VAS and fetal blood pH) to type of FHR decelerations, and the predictability of neonatal morbidity by two tests were analyzed. Where appropriate, Fisher's exact test (p<0.05 was considered statistically different) and the odd ratio with 95% confidence intervals were used for statistical analyses.\nRESULTS: Excellent association between acceleration response to VAS and pH>or = 7.20, and between a negative response to VAS (no acceleration or decelerations) and pH<7.20 were found in the first stage of labor, the second stage of labor, and the combination of both stages together (p = 0.0001, OR = 10.6 [3.3-34.0]). It was observed that negative VAS responses for predicting fetal acidosis (pH<7.20) were comparable between term (>or = 37 weeks) and preterm (<37 weeks,>or = 34 weeks) fetuses. Since the preterm fetuses enrolled in the study were limited in number, it is difficult to draw adequate conclusions. The positive predictive value (PPV) of fetal acidosis was 67% in both groups of FHR variable decelerations and late decelerations, but the false negative rate of acceleration VAS response for predicting no acidosis was significantly higher in the group of late decelerations (29% vs 8%, p = 0.034). Finally, both a negative VAS response and fetal acidosis (pH<7.20) have equal predictability for neonatal morbidity.

The plate group had higher pressure (301.4 vs. 183.3) and more regression coefficients (120 vs. 142), which are significant (p<0.05). The plate groups also had higher displacement pressures compared to the other groups, which suggests better stability.\n\nSo, the conclusion here is that the addition of the sternal plate improves sternal stability.

This study examines the ability of neutrophils isolated (over the first 24 hrs) from the peripheral blood of patients admitted after major trauma to migrate in response to interleukin-8. Interleukin-8 is elevated in the lung within 2 hrs of major trauma in patients who later develop ARDS, and thus it plays a central role in the recruitment of neutrophils to the lung and their subsequent activation. We hypothesized that enhanced interleukin-8-mediated neutrophil migratory activity in the early postinjury phase, before the development of ARDS, may be a crucial factor in the etiology of ARDS.\nDESIGN: Prospective observational study.\nSETTING: University Hospital Wales, the Royal Gwent Hospital, and East Glamorgan General Hospital. Laboratory work was conducted at the Institute of Nephrology.\nPATIENTS: Adult blunt trauma victims with Injury Severity Score>or = 18.\nMEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Neutrophils were isolated from citrated blood from 17 adult blunt major trauma patients at admission (0 hrs) and 8 and 24 hrs later.

The neutrophil count in each specimen was measured, and the number of neutrophils migrating across porous tissue culture inserts in response to defined concentrations of interleukin-8 (0, 10, 30, and 100 ng/mL) was quantitated by peroxidase assay. Neutrophil counts in the whole blood specimens obtained from those later developing ARDS were elevated significantly at admission and declined rapidly throughout the next 24 hrs. Significantly greater numbers of trauma patients' neutrophils migrated to concentrations of interleukin-8 (30 and 100 ng/mL) at each time point when compared with normal volunteers (Mann-Whitney U test, p<.05).

The FTR group had 190 patients and the control group had 245. The alloimmunization rate was 8% vs. 3% (p=0.026). The control group was younger and had more blood products on the day of the event and over the next 10 days. The FTR group had a higher rate.\n\nSo, the key here is whether the febrile reaction to PLTs caused more alloimmunization. The study found that the FTR group had higher rates, which suggests a link. But I need to check if there's any mention of other factors. The study says the event was defined as the PLT that caused the FTR or the index PLT in the control group. The numbers show a significant difference, so that supports the conclusion.\n\nSince the results are statistically significant (p=0.026) and the comparison between the two groups shows a higher rate in the FTR group, it's likely that the febrile reaction to platelets contributes to alloimmunization. Therefore, the answer should be \"yes.\"\n</think>", "model_answer": "yes", "reference_long_answer": "These preliminary data support our hypothesis that recipient inflammation may affect RBC alloimmunization in humans; however, a more detailed understanding of the pathophysiologic association between inflammation and alloimmunization is required before definitive conclusions can be reached.", "reference_final_decision": "yes"}

Creatine is an important intracellular metabolite obtained from the diet and also synthesised endogenously. Experimental evidence suggests that the fetus relies on a maternal supply of creatine for much of gestation. However, the impact of pregnancy on maternal creatine homeostasis is unclear. We hypothesise that alteration of maternal creatine homeostasis occurs during pregnancy to ensure adequate levels of this essential substrate are available for maternal tissues, the placenta and fetus. This study aimed to describe maternal creatine homeostasis from mid to late gestation in the precocial spiny mouse.\nMETHODS: Plasma creatine concentration and urinary excretion were measured from mid to late gestation in pregnant (n = 8) and age-matched virgin female spiny mice (n = 6). At term, body composition and organ weights were assessed and tissue total creatine content determined. mRNA expression of the creatine synthesising enzymes arginine:glycine amidinotransferase (AGAT) and guanidinoacetate methyltransferase (GAMT), and the creatine transporter (CrT1) were assessed by RT-qPCR. Protein expression of AGAT and GAMT was also assessed by western blot analysis.\nRESULTS: Plasma creatine and renal creatine excretion decreased significantly from mid to late gestation (P<0.001, P<0.05, respectively). Pregnancy resulted in increased lean tissue (P<0.01), kidney (P<0.01), liver (P<0.01) and heart (P<0.05) mass at term. CrT1 expression was increased in the heart (P<0.05) and skeletal muscle (P<0.05) at term compared to non-pregnant tissues, and creatine content of the heart (P<0.05) and kidney (P<0.001) were also increased at this time. CrT1 mRNA expression was down-regulated in the liver (<0.01) and brain (<0.01) of pregnant spiny mice at term. Renal AGAT mRNA (P<0.01) and protein (P<0.05) expression were both significantly up-regulated at term, with decreased expression of AGAT mRNA (<0.01) and GAMT protein (<0.05) observed in the term pregnant heart. Brain AGAT (<0.01) and GAMT (<0.001) mRNA expression were also decreased at term."}], "thinking": "<think>\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The question is whether maternal creatine homeostasis is altered during gestation as a metabolic adaptation to pregnancy. The context provided is about a study in spiny mice where they measured creatine levels, organ masses, and gene expressions during pregnancy compared to non-pregnant mice.\n\nFirst, the study found that plasma creatine and renal excretion decreased from mid to late gestation. That seems counterintuitive because during pregnancy, the body should be using more creatine. But the results show a decrease, so maybe the decrease is due to the metabolic changes rather than a direct loss. \n\nNext, there's an increase in lean tissue, kidney, liver, and heart mass at term. These are all typical changes during pregnancy. The heart, for example, has increased mass, which makes sense for energy storage. The liver and kidneys also show increased weights, which supports metabolic demands.\n\nCrT1 expression was upregulated in the heart and skeletal muscle at term. Creatine transporter CrT1 is crucial for transporting creatine into cells. If it's upregulated, that suggests more creatine is being transported to tissues, which would support the increased needs of the placenta and fetus. The creatine content in the heart and kidney increased too, which aligns with the idea that the body is maintaining sufficient creatine supply.\n\nHowever, the study also found that CrT1 mRNA was downregulated in the liver and brain at term. This suggests that the transporter might be being used more efficiently, or perhaps there's a balance between production and transport. The question is about whether this is a metabolic adaptation. The decrease in creatine levels might be a compensatory mechanism, like using the increased tissue mass to store more creatine, which supports the metabolic demands.\n\nThe conclusion from the study is that the maternal creatine homeostasis is altered during pregnancy. The evidence supports that the body is adjusting to meet the increased needs of the placenta and fetus by altering creatine levels and transporter activity. The results show both decreases in creatine and increases in tissue mass, along with changes in gene expression, which collectively suggest that maternal creatine homeostasis is indeed a metabolic adaptation to pregnancy.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the evidence supports that maternal creatine homeostasis is altered during gestation as a metabolic adaptation. Therefore, the answer should be \"yes.\"\n</think>", "model_answer": "yes", "reference_long_answer": "Change of maternal creatine status (increased creatine synthesis and reduced creatine excretion) may be a necessary adjustment of maternal physiology to pregnancy to meet the metabolic demands of maternal tissues, the placenta and developing fetus.", "reference_final_decision": "yes"}

The study found that SL was used for extensive disease or metastases in 56 patients. Out of these, 7% of patients had unresectable tumors. The yield of SL was 7%, and the accuracy was 27%. Additionally, 45 patients had a biopsy of the contralateral liver, leading to changes in management for 4 patients. \n\nWait, the results mention that 7% of patients had SL unsuccessful due to intraabdominal adhesions. But the other 4 patients had metastases, tumor progression, or cirrhosis. The yield was 7%, which is a small percentage. The accuracy was 27%, which is a reasonable number for a staging procedure. \n\nThe key points here are that SL is used for some cases, but it's not as effective as open surgery. The study's conclusion is that SL is useful because it helps in staging, but the results show that it's not the most effective. The yield and accuracy are low, which might indicate that SL isn't the best option. \n\nSince the question is about usefulness, the answer would depend on whether the study supports that SL is useful. The study shows that SL is used, but it's not as effective as open surgery. Therefore, the evidence might suggest that SL isn't useful. However, the study's results are mixed; some cases were treated, and others were not. \n\nThe answer needs to be \"maybe\" because the evidence isn't conclusive. The study shows that SL is used, but there are limitations. So, while it's useful in some cases, it's not the best option. Therefore, the answer is maybe.\n</think>", "model_answer": "maybe", "reference_long_answer": "The overall yield of SL for HCC was 7 %, and the accuracy was 27 %.

We investigate whether manuscripts that contain a citation to the reviewer's work receive higher evaluations than those that do not and whether peer reviewers encourage authors to cite that reviewer's work.\nMETHODS: We analyzed all research manuscripts submitted in 2012 to Annals of Emergency Medicine to determine whether they contained citations to each reviewer's work. To determine whether citation affected reviewer scores, we obtained each reviewer's score of the manuscript's overall desirability (1=worst to 5=best) and used descriptive statistics and regression modeling to compare scores of cited and noncited reviewers. We also enumerated how often reviewers suggested that authors add citations to the reviewer's work or other work.\nRESULTS: There were 395 manuscripts and 999 corresponding reviews with an manuscript desirability score. The 83 reviews by cited reviewers (8.3%) had a mean score of 2.8 (SD 1.4); the 916 reviews by noncited reviewers (91.7%), 2.5 (1.2; Δ=0.3; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0 to 0.6). The mean score in the 117 reviews of the noncited reviewers of the 57 manuscripts that had both cited and noncited reviewers was 2.9 (SD 1.2) compared with 2.9 (SD 1.1) for the 68 reviews by cited reviewers (Δ=0; 95% CI -0.3 to 0.4). In the final ordinal regression model, the unadjusted OR for the manuscript desirability score was 1.6 (95% CI 1.0 to 2.7); when adjusting for the manuscripts' mean desirability score, it was 1.4 (95% CI 0.8 to 2.2), demonstrating that manuscript quality was a confounder.

The study found that 83 out of 999 reviews by cited reviewers had a mean score of 2.8, while noncited reviewers had a mean of 2.5. The comparison between noncited and cited reviews shows a statistically significant difference. The mean score for noncited reviews (2.9) is slightly higher than that of cited reviewers (2.8), but there's a small difference in the confidence interval. However, the regression model adjusted for the mean desirability score, which was a confounder, showing that the OR (odds ratio) for the manuscript quality was 1.4, not 1.6. This suggests that the manuscript quality itself was a confounder, not the citations.\n\nThen, there's a part about 28 reviews where authors added citations to the reviewer's work, and 98 where they added citations to other works. But the main point is the score comparison. The results show that when manuscripts had citations to the reviewer, the reviewer scores were higher. However, after adjusting for the mean desirability, the effect was reduced, implying that the manuscript quality was the real factor. So, the citations to the reviewer's work did have a positive effect, but after controlling for other variables, the influence was less. \n\nThe conclusion here is that the citations had an influence, but it was not statistically significant after adjusting for confounding variables.

PPM was defined as indexed effective orifice area less than 0.85 cm². The results showed that 78% had PPM, with 42% at 0.75 cm² and 17 at 0.65 cm². Overall survival at 5 years was 78% (not influenced by PPM). The New York Heart Association class improved for long-term survivors with PPM, and QoL scores were similar between PPM and no-PPM groups.\n\nSo, survival was not affected by PPM. The improvement in NYHA class for PPM patients suggests that those with mismatch might have better outcomes. But the QoL scores didn't show a difference. Therefore, the evidence here is that PPM doesn't impact survival or QoL in this group. So the answer should be \"yes\" because the results confirm that PPM doesn't affect survival and QoL.\n</think>", "model_answer": "yes", "reference_long_answer": "PPM after AVR does not affect survival, functional status, and QoL in patients aged at least 75 years. Surgical procedures, often time-consuming, contemplated to prevent PPM, may therefore be not justified in this patient subgroup.", "reference_final_decision": "no"}

MR angiography and DSA were performed in 84 patients (56 men, 28 women; age range, 61-76 years) with carotid artery stenosis at Doppler ultrasonography. Three readers reviewed the first-pass, steady-state, and combined MR data sets, and one independent observer evaluated the DSA images to assess stenosis degree, plaque morphology and ulceration, stenosis length, and tandem lesions. Interobserver agreement regarding MR angiographic findings was analyzed by using intraclass correlation and Cohen kappa coefficients. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) were calculated by using the McNemar test to determine possible significant differences (P<.05).\nRESULTS: Interobserver agreement regarding all MR angiogram readings was substantial.

The study mentions that interobserver agreement was substantial, which suggests that all methods were consistent.

A pathologist blinded to the child's eventual outcome graded the pre-Kasai needle liver biopsy results according to duct proliferation, ductal plate lesion, bile in ducts, lobular inflammation, giant cells, syncitial giant cells, focal necrosis, bridging necrosis, hepatocyte ballooning, bile in zone 1, 2, and 3, cholangitis, and end-stage cirrhosis. Clinical outcome was then predicted.\nRESULTS: Success after portoenterostomy could not reliably be predicted based on gender, age at Kasai, preoperative bilirubin or albumin levels. Histological criteria, however, predicted outcome in 27 of 31 patients (P<.01). Fifteen of 17 clinical successes were correctly predicted; as were 12 of 14 clinical failures (sensitivity, 86%; specificity, 88%). Individually, the presence of syncitial giant cells, lobular inflammation, focal necrosis, bridging necrosis, and cholangitis, were each associated with failure of the portoenterostomy (P<.05).

Fondaparinux's extended half-life of 17-21 hours complicates its use as a perioperative bridging therapy. The ideal time for discontinuation before surgery is an issue, particularly in surgeries with a high bleeding risk or in which neuraxial anesthesia is used. Guidance for perioperative bridging with fondaparinux must be derived from pharmacokinetic data, surgical prophylaxis trials, case reports, and anesthesia guidelines. Published trials used fondaparinux sodium 2.5 mg daily for venous thromboembolism prophylaxis in surgical patients, and the majority avoided its use before surgery in patients receiving neuraxial anesthesia. Three case reports cited the use of fondaparinux sodium as perioperative bridge therapy; one used a 2.5-mg dose, and the other two used a full treatment dose of 7.5 mg. Furthermore, professional anesthesia guidelines conflict in their recommendations regarding the timing of drug administration with neuraxial catheter use. For these reasons, it may be optimal to avoid fondaparinux use before surgery. In some instances, the use of low-molecular-weight heparin or inpatient use of i.v. unfractionated heparin is not possible, is contraindicated, or has limited efficacy, such as a patient with history of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia or antithrombin III deficiency. Fondaparinux may have a role in bridge therapy for these patients."}], "thinking": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if fondaparinux has a role in perioperative bridging. The context provided is about the use of fondaparinux as a bridging agent.\n\nFirst, I need to check the summary. The summary says that anticoagulation guidelines give minimal guidance on using fondaparinux. The half-life is 17-21 hours, which complicates its use as a bridge. The ideal time to stop before surgery is an issue, especially with high bleeding risk or neuraxial anesthesia. They mention that trials used 2.5 mg daily for venous thrombosis and avoided it before surgery in patients with neuraxial anesthesia. There are three case reports using 2.5 mg and two using 7.5 mg. Also, anesthesia guidelines conflict on timing with neuraxial catheter use. The conclusion is that it may be optimal to avoid fondaparinux before surgery, and in some cases, low-molecular heparin or inpatient use is not possible.\n\nSo, the key points are: the half-life complicates use, the ideal time for discontinuation is unclear, trials show it's avoided before surgery, case reports exist, and guidelines conflict.

However, it has not been clarified yet whether these deviations also occur during motor tasks not involving the back and whether the performance is influenced by pain and pain-related cognitions. Therefore, the aim of the present study is to get insight in the contribution of both pain experience and pain-related cognitions to general motor task performance in CLBP.\nMETHODS: 13 CLBP patients and 15 healthy subjects performed a hand-function task in three conditions: sitting, lying prone (lying) and lying prone without trunk support (provoking). The last condition was assumed to provoke pain-related cognitions, which was considered successful when a patients' pain expectancy on a numeric rating scale was at least 1 point higher than actual pain experienced. Subjects' performance was expressed in reaction time and movement time. Repeated measures analysis of variance was performed to detect main effect for group and condition. Special interest was given to group*condition interaction, since significant interaction would indicate that patients and healthy subjects performed differently throughout the three conditions.\nRESULTS: Patients were slower throughout all conditions compared to healthy subjects. With respect to the provoking condition, patients showed deteriorated performance compared to lying while healthy subjects' performance remained equal between these two conditions.

Also, the interaction between group (CLBP vs healthy) and condition (sitting, prone, provoking) was significant, which suggests that the effect varies across conditions.\n\nThe conclusion here is that the provoking condition (which is associated with pain-related cognitions) led to worse motor performance. The fact that the patients showed deteriorated performance in the provoking condition and that their reaction time and movement time were lower than in the healthy subjects supports this. The study's design uses repeated measures ANOVA, so they're looking for main effects and interactions, which they did. \n\nSo, based on the results, it seems that pain-related cognitions do influence motor performance in CLBP, especially in the provoking condition.

Other variables that predicted longer survival after breast cancer recurrence included smaller initial tumor size, lower stage of disease, fewer lymph nodes involved, longer disease-free interval, estrogen receptor-positive tumors, and nonvisceral dominant site of disease recurrence.

The question is whether c-kit proto-oncogen expression has a diagnostic role in hepatitis B virus-induced chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, and HCC.\n\nFirst, looking at the context provided. The study used immunohistochemistry on 125 patients with HBV infection, divided into mild, moderate, severe hepatitis, cirrhosis, and HCC. They found that in cirrhosis, c-kit positivity was lower and rarely present. In severe hepatitis and HCC, c-kit was more present and showed higher intensity. Also, in chronic hepatitis, the staining intensity matched the disease's severity and stage. In fibrosis areas, c-kit was rare or absent. In HCC, it was present both inside and around the cancerous cells, and 82% of specimens had c-kit positivity (p<0.001).\n\nSo, the key points are that in severe cases (severe HBV infection, HCC), c-kit is more common. In cirrhosis, it's less. In chronic hepatitis, it's in line with the disease. The study also mentions that 82% of HCC had c-kit positivity, which is a significant finding. \n\nNow, considering the diagnostic role. If c-kit expression is present in these diseases and can be used as a marker, then yes. But if not, maybe no. The study supports that in severe HBV infection and HCC, c-kit is present, which would suggest a diagnostic role. However, cirrhosis has lower levels. But cirrhosis is a stage, not necessarily a disease. The question is about the presence in the diseases. So, since c-kit is present in severe HBV, HCC, and chronic hepatitis, it's likely a diagnostic marker. \n\nThe conclusion here would be yes, because the evidence supports that c-kit expression is present in these conditions and has a role in diagnosis. The answer should be yes.\n</think>", "model_answer": "yes", "reference_long_answer": "C-kit positivity was observed in the mitotic, proliferating and also dysplastic hepatic cells.

They used image cytometry to measure this fraction and looked at recurrence-free survival and overall survival.\n\nThe results show that the S + G2/M fraction was statistically significant after the median time to relapse (1.5 years) and overall survival. Also, the effect was delayed until three years after death. The tumors with low S + G2/M had smaller sizes and were more estrogen and progesterone receptor-positive.\n\nSo, the key points are that the index was significant in both groups at the time of analysis and had a delayed effect. This suggests that the proliferative index does provide prognostic information. Therefore, the answer should be \"yes.\"\n</think>", "model_answer": "yes", "reference_long_answer": "According to ICM-DNA values corresponding to the S + G2/M region, patients with breast cancers classified as Auer IV can be divided into subgroups with different tumor characteristics and prognoses.", "reference_final_decision": "yes"}

They analyzed 20,885 cases, with 235 IVF/ICSI and 20,650 control. They found that CPM incidence was lower in the IVF group (1.3%) compared to the control (2.2%). Fetal chromosomal anomalies were higher in the control group (4.3%) versus IVF (2.4%).

However, the odds ratio for fetal anomalies was higher, but again, the study says the differences were not statistically significant. \n\nThe question is about adverse perinatal outcomes. The study's conclusion is that there's no significant difference between IVF/ICSI and spontaneous conceptions in terms of CPM incidence or fetal anomalies. So, if CPM is a factor in the perinatal outcomes, but the study didn't find a statistically significant association, then maybe it's not a contributing factor.

If the incidence of CPM is lower in IVF, but the study didn't find significant differences, does that mean it's not a contributing factor?

Complete clinical charts were reviewed by a pediatric hematologist with training in infectious diseases to determine a clinical standard to define the presence or absence of osteomyelitis. A pediatric radiologist reviewed all MR imaging and was blinded to clinical information. Based on the signal intensity in T1-W fat-saturated images, the children were further classified as positive for osteomyelitis (low bone marrow signal intensity) or positive for bone infarct (high bone marrow signal intensity).\nRESULTS: Based on the clinical standard, 5 children were classified as positive for osteomyelitis and 26 children as positive for bone infarct (negative for osteomyelitis).

Although past and emerging research indicates that ESC is effective in reducing collision rates and saving lives, and its inclusion in all vehicle platforms is encouraged, drivers may demonstrate behavioral adaptation or an overreliance on ESC that could offset or reduce its overall effectiveness. The main objective of the present study was to determine whether behavioral adaptation to ESC is likely to occur upon the widespread introduction of ESC into the Canadian vehicle fleet. Secondary objectives were to confirm the results of a previous ESC public survey and to generate a baseline measure for the future assessment of planned and ongoing ESC promotional activities in Canada.\nMETHODS: Two separate telephone surveys evaluated drivers' perceptions and awareness of ESC. The first surveyed 500 randomly selected owners/drivers of passenger vehicles. The second surveyed 1017 owners/drivers of 2006-2008 ESC-equipped passenger vehicles from the provinces of Quebec and British Columbia, Canada.\nRESULTS: Though ESC drivers were much more likely than drivers of other vehicles to be aware of ESC (77% vs. 39%) and that their own vehicle was equipped with it (63% vs. 8%), 23 percent had never heard of it. Ninety percent of drivers who knew that their vehicle was equipped with ESC believed that ESC had made it safer to drive and reported being confident that ESC would work in an emergency. Twenty-three percent of ESC owners who knew their vehicle had ESC reported noticing long-lasting changes in their driving behavior since they began driving the vehicle."}], "thinking": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question.

Then, 90% of drivers who knew their vehicle had ESC said it made their driving safer and confident. \n\nNow, the question is about whether behavioral adaptation to ESC occurs. The study's secondary objectives included confirming previous ESC surveys and establishing a baseline for future assessments. The results show that drivers are aware of ESC and its presence, but some may not have heard of it. However, the majority of drivers who know their vehicle has ESC believe it helps and feel confident. \n\nWait, the result says 23% had never heard of it. But the other 77% and 63% are aware. So, if a driver knows their vehicle has ESC, they might be more likely to adapt their driving behavior. The study mentions that 23% of ESC owners who knew their vehicle had noticed changes in their driving behavior. \n\nSo, does that mean that drivers are adapting? The study's conclusion is that there's a baseline measure for future assessments, suggesting that even with widespread adoption, there might still be behavioral changes. The answer here would be maybe because while awareness is high, behavioral adaptation isn't fully confirmed. The results don't definitively say it's positive or negative, just that some drivers adapt. Therefore, the answer should be maybe.\n</think>", "model_answer": "maybe", "reference_long_answer": "Collectively, results suggest that behavioral adaptation to ESC is likely in certain drivers; however, its proven effectiveness in reducing the likelihood of being involved in a serious crash probably outweighs any potential increases in unsafe driving.

Past fentanyl access was primarily oral or dermal via prescription fentanyl patch diversion. One factor potentially driving this increase in fatalities is the change in route of administration. Rapid intravenous (IV) fentanyl can produce chest wall rigidity. We evaluated post-mortem fentanyl and norfentanyl concentrations in a recent surge of lethal fentanyl intoxications.\nMETHODS: Fentanyl related deaths from the Franklin County coroner's office from January to September 2015 were identified. Presumptive positive fentanyl results were confirmed by quantitative analysis using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) and were able to quantify fentanyl, norfentanyl, alfentanyl, and sufentanyl.\nRESULTS: 48 fentanyl deaths were identified. Mean fentanyl concentrations were 12.5 ng/ml, (range 0.5 ng/ml to >40 ng/ml). Mean norfentanyl concentrations were 1.9 ng/ml (range none detected to 8.3 ng/ml). No appreciable concentrations of norfentanyl could be detected in 20 of 48 cases (42%) and were less than 1 ng/ml in 25 cases (52%). Elevated fentanyl concentrations did not correlate with rises in norfentanyl levels. In several cases fentanyl concentrations were strikingly high (22 ng/ml and 20 ng/ml) with no norfentanyl detected.\nDISCUSSION: The lack of any measurable norfentanyl in half of our cases suggests a very rapid death, consistent with acute chest rigidity. An alternate explanation could be a dose-related rapid onset of respiratory arrest. Deaths occurred with low levels of fentanyl in the therapeutic range (1-2 ng/ml) in apparent non-naïve opiate abusers.

The context provided is about a recent surge in fentanyl deaths linked to IV administration, and they found that fentanyl and norfentanyl concentrations were high in cases where IV was used.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what chest wall rigidity means. From what I know, it's a symptom of respiratory failure, especially when there's acute respiratory arrest. Rapid IV fentanyl administration is supposed to cause this, so the context says that fentanyl concentrations were high in those cases, which would support the idea that chest rigidity is a result.\n\nThe study included 48 deaths, with high fentanyl concentrations. They also found no norfentanyl in half of the cases, which suggests that the primary factor is fentanyl. The conclusion in the discussion mentions that the absence of norfentanyl implies rapid death, which aligns with chest rigidity. Since there's no mention of norfentanyl in the cases, it's safe to infer that chest rigidity is the main cause here.\n\nSo, based on the evidence, the answer should be yes. The evidence supports that chest wall rigidity is a factor contributing to rapid death from fentanyl overdose, especially when administered via IV. The study's findings directly link the administration route (IV) to the presence of fentanyl, which in turn leads to the rigidity.\n</think>", "model_answer": "yes", "reference_long_answer": "In summary we believe sudden onset chest wall rigidity may be a significant and previously unreported factor leading to an increased mortality, from illicit IV fentanyl use.

The hypothesis is that there is an increased uptake of FDG under hypoxic conditions secondary to enhanced glycolysis, compensating the hypoxia-induced loss of cellular energy production. Several studies have already addressed this issue, some with conflicting results. This study aimed to compare the tracers (14)C-EF3 and (18)F-FDG to detect hypoxia in mouse tumor models.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: C3H, tumor-bearing mice (FSAII and SCCVII tumors) were injected iv with (14)C-EF3, and 1h later with (18)F-FDG. Using a specifically designed immobilization device with fiducial markers, PET (Mosaic®, Philips) images were acquired 1h after the FDG injection. After imaging, the device containing mouse was frozen, transversally sliced and imaged with autoradiography (AR) (FLA-5100, Fujifilm) to obtain high resolution images of the (18)F-FDG distribution within the tumor area. After a 48-h delay allowing for (18)F decay a second AR was performed to image (14)C-EF3 distribution. AR images were aligned to reconstruct the full 3D tumor volume, and were compared with the PET images. Image segmentation with threshold-based methods was applied on both AR and PET images to derive various tracer activity volumes. The matching index DSI (dice similarity index) was then computed. The comparison was performed under normoxic (ambient air\n, FSAII: n=4, SCCVII, n=5) and under hypoxic conditions (10% O(2) breathing\n, SCCVII: n=4).\nRESULTS: On AR, under both ambient air and hypoxic conditions, there was a decreasing similarity between (14)C-EF3 and FDG with higher activity sub-volumes. Under normoxic conditions, when comparing the 10% of tumor voxels with the highest (18)F-FDG or (14)C-EF3 activity, a DSI of 0.24 and 0.20 was found for FSAII and SCCVII, respectively. Under hypoxic conditions, a DSI of 0.36 was observed for SCCVII tumors. When comparing the (14)C-EF3 distribution in AR with the corresponding (18)F-FDG-PET images, the DSI reached values of 0.26, 0.22 and 0.21 for FSAII and SCCVII under normoxia and SCCVII under hypoxia, respectively."}], "thinking": "<think>\nOkay, let's see.

The study compared (14)C-EF3 and (18)F-FDG in mouse tumor models. They used PET imaging to detect hypoxia. The hypothesis was that hypoxia leads to increased glycolysis, which makes FDG uptake higher, compensating for the loss of energy.\n\nThe results showed that under normoxic conditions, both FDG and (14)C-EF3 had lower similarity in AR images. However, under hypoxic conditions, FDG had a higher DSI (dice similarity index), which is a measure of similarity between two images. The DSI values under hypoxia were higher for FDG compared to (14)C-EF3. This suggests that FDG is more effective in detecting hypoxia.\n\nThe study also mentions that DSI was calculated under both normoxic and hypoxic conditions. The comparison between FDG and (14)C-EF3 shows that FDG has a better DSI under hypoxia, supporting the idea that FDG acts as a surrogate tracer for hypoxia.\n\nTherefore, based on the findings, (18)F-FDG is indeed a surrogate tracer to measure tumor hypoxia.

However, whereas single measures during static conditions generally failed in linking beta E levels with psychopathology, dynamic changes of beta E in particular have been shown to be associated with spells of anxiety and depression. During alcohol withdrawal, a decreased secretion of beta E with a delayed normalization has been reported, but up to now only few data became available regarding the interaction of plasma beta E and psychopathological parameters.\nOBJECTIVES: The aim of our study was to test the hypothesis whether beta E during acute alcohol withdrawal is associated with anxiety, depression, and craving.\nMETHODS: We observed self-rated anxiety, depression, and craving during alcohol withdrawal and assessed beta E levels (RIA) in a consecutive sample of 60 alcoholics on day 1 and day 14 after onset of withdrawal, and in 30 healthy volunteers. To control for mutual interactions of beta E and the pituitary-adrenocortical hormone secretion, plasma corticotropin (ACTH) and cortisol were also determined.\nRESULTS: In accordance with prior studies, beta E was significantly lowered on day 1 and day 14 of alcohol withdrawal relative to controls. Plasma levels of ACTH correlated significantly with beta E in alcoholics at both time points and in controls, without differing significantly between the groups. Self-rated anxiety, depression, and alcohol craving decreased significantly between day 1 and day 14. Levels of beta E were inversely correlated with anxiety day 1 (r=-0.58) and day 14 (r=-0.71). Partial correlation coefficients controlling for ACTH plasma levels revealed that this correlation was largely independent from ACTH.

The question is whether withdrawal-induced anxiety in alcoholism is based on beta-endorphin deficiency.

They measured RIA (probably a blood test for beta-endorphin) and found that beta E was significantly lower on days 1 and 14. So that's a direct link between withdrawal and lower beta-endorphin.\n\nBut wait, the question is about beta-endorphin deficiency causing anxiety. The study shows that beta-endorphin is low during withdrawal, and that this is associated with anxiety. So the presence of low beta-endorphin levels during withdrawal is linked to anxiety.

There have been limited studies about the effectiveness of clinical supervision for allied health and minimal studies conducted within the Australian health context. The aim of the present study was to identify whether clinical supervision was perceived to be effective by allied health professionals and to identify components that contributed to effectiveness. Participants completed an anonymous online questionnaire, administered through the health service's intranet.\nMETHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted with community allied health workers (n = 82) 8 months after implementation of structured clinical supervision. Demographic data (age, gender), work-related history (profession employment level, years of experience), and supervision practice (number and length of supervision sessions) were collected through an online survey. The outcome measure, clinical supervision effectiveness, was operationalised using the Manchester Clinical Supervision Scale-26 (MCSS-26). Data were analysed with Pearson correlation (r) and independent sample t-tests (t) with significance set at 0.05 (ie the probability of significant difference set at P<0.05).\nRESULTS: The length of the supervision sessions (r(s) ≥ 0.44), the number of sessions (r(s) ≥ 0.35) and the total period supervision had been received (r(s) ≥ 0.42) were all significantly positively correlated with the MCSS-26 domains of clinical supervision effectiveness.

The key findings are that supervision sessions (length, number, total period) were positively correlated with MCSS-26 scores, which measure effectiveness. Also, specific factors like receiving supervision, having choice in allocation, and completing a contract were associated with higher scores. \n\nNow, the question is about sustaining the workforce. If the study shows that clinical supervision improves effectiveness, does that mean it supports the workforce? Well, if the workforce is engaged and supported through effective supervision, then yes. But the study only looked at effectiveness, not necessarily the long-term impact on workforce retention or sustainability. \n\nThe conclusion from the study is that the variables correlated with effectiveness, but the main point is about effectiveness. The answer should be \"yes\" if the effectiveness supports workforce sustainability. However, the study might not have addressed workforce sustainability directly. But since the variables that affect effectiveness are linked to the workforce, maybe the answer is yes. Wait, but maybe the question is whether the supervision itself sustains the workforce.

The context provided is a study where 505 women with myomas underwent laparoscopic myomectomy. The study compared different groups based on size, number, and location of myomas.\n\nFirst, I need to check if the study's results support that these factors are limiting factors. The study mentions that in all comparisons, larger myomas or more myomas were associated with greater blood loss, longer surgery time, and more hospital stays. However, the weight and size of the removed myomas were proportionally larger in these groups. That seems contradictory because if larger myomas are harder to remove, wouldn't they have a higher size, which could be a limiting factor? But the study says that the weight and size were proportionally larger, which might mean that even though the factors were limiting, the size wasn't the main issue. \n\nWait, the study says that in the groups with larger myomas or more myomas, the weight and size were proportionally larger. So even though those factors were limiting, the size wasn't the main problem. That suggests that the size, number, and location of myomas might not be the main limiting factors. Instead, other factors like blood loss and surgery duration might be. \n\nBut the question is about whether size, number, and location are factors. The study's results don't directly address whether these factors are limiting. They do note that larger myomas or more myomas were associated with higher outcomes, but the size and number themselves aren't the main issue. Therefore, the evidence here would be that while these factors may influence outcomes, they are not the primary limiting factors for laparoscopic myomectomy. \n\nSo the answer should be maybe because the study's results don't directly address whether size, number, or location are limiting factors, but rather note that other factors are. But I need to make sure I'm not missing anything. Let me check again. The study says that the weight and size were proportionally larger in those groups, but that doesn't mean they are limiting factors. It just means that those factors were associated with higher outcomes. Therefore, the evidence is inconclusive, so maybe. \n\nWait, the original question is whether size, number, and location are limiting factors. The study's results don't directly confirm that these factors are limiting. They mention that they might be, but the outcome data (like blood loss, duration, etc.) are higher.

While mutation analysis is important for predictive diagnosis in persons at risk, its relevance for clinical management of individual patients is open to question.\nMETHODS: We examined 680 unrelated FAP families for germline mutations in the APC gene. Clinical information was obtained from 1256 patients.\nRESULTS: APC mutations were detected in 48% (327/680) of families. Age at diagnosis of FAP based on bowel symptoms and age at diagnosis of colorectal cancer in untreated patients were used as indicators of the severity of the natural course of the disease. A germline mutation was detected in 230 of 404 patients who were diagnosed after onset of bowel symptoms (rectal bleeding, abdominal pain, diarrhoea). When these patients were grouped according to the different sites of mutations, mean values for age at onset of disease differed significantly: patients carrying APC mutations at codon 1309 showed a disease onset 10 years earlier (mean age 20 years) compared with patients with mutations between codons 168 and 1580 (except codon 1309) (mean age 30 years), whereas patients with mutations at the 5' end of codon 168 or the 3' end of codon 1580 were diagnosed at a mean age of 52 years. Within each group of patients however large phenotypic variation was observed, even among patients with identical germline mutations.

For nodal metastases, LUS had a 94% sensitivity versus 18% pre-op and 6% laparoscopy. That's a significant improvement. But the specificity was low at 53%, which is worse than laparoscopy.

Because these studies did not use multiparity as exclusion criteria which reduces confounding with previous pregnancies, aim of this study is to compare mode of delivery of different techniques of ART using data of primiparae only [1, 2].\nMETHODS: Retrospective analysis of patient data treated at the university hospital of Luebeck in a period of 12 years. Patients were divided in different groups according to their way of conception: spontaneous conception and conception after ART. The group of ART was further divided into: (a) a group of fresh transferred embryos (IVF/ICSI), (b) vitrification and (c) slow freezing. Exclusion criteria were defined as: multiparity, delivery<24. + 0 p.m., incomplete data and treatment outside university of Luebeck. Main parameter of this study was mode of delivery which was divided into spontaneous delivery or C-section.
